Notes from homework

-Design choice, intitally set up an individual cow, chicken and pig. however now that I have progressed further I realised they should
have all been under one class animal. 
-Things I discovered:
-Exception has its own class built into Java so that why you can extend to it and it knows exactly where to extend to even
though you have not set up that class

-You can write ...extends...implements in the one line

-The main difference between and abstract class and an interface is that an interface is a must for all classes to do.
For example all animals have the ability 'to eat' there and interface force upon them this action that they all can do.
an abstract class is different in the sense it layout the blueprint for your classes, and hence when you inherit 
attributes, these attributes can be assigned to different values. 

-Exceptions and when to use them. It is a handle for the high chance of an input being made that will crash your 
programme. For example if your method needed to have i.e a car to pass through inorder to run but that car does not exist.
Instead of the programme not knowing what to do with situation it will go through specific steps to handle this error.
